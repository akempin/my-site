        <h3>Hi there! My name is Adam Kempin, and I am a web developer who has been living in China for the last 7 years. Currently, I am back in London developing my skills in back-end development, particularly in Ruby on Rails.</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>I originally went to China to learn Mandarin while working in a charitable position for the British Council teaching English at Yaohua Middle School in Tianjin. After finishing my contract with Yaohua, I moved on to teach EFL at Web International English, a highly regarded English training school with a focus on graduates and young professionals looking to find work abroad.<br/>
      After 3 years in Tianjin and with my Chinese now fluent, I felt it was time to move on, and was given the great opportunity to head to Beijing, where I have worked for the last 4 years as Operations Manager for iConcerts China. For iConcerts China I managed all business development and contracts and the subsequent maintainence of these contractual obligations with our Chinese partners. Everyday tasks also included editing, bux-fixing, translation and maintaining of the website front-end and back-end systems as well as programme delivery, market research, logistics, metadata and rights management.<br/>
 Since I was originally the sole representative of iConcerts in China, I was required to take on a variety of roles, and as such I proved myself to be capable of taking on and adapting to new roles incredibly quickly. These roles included but were limited to development and design of the iConcerts website, creating promotional and marketing materials, meeting and sourcing new clients and presenting iConcerts services and content, translating at business meetings as well as translating and amending contracts and the HR involved in hiring a web designer and marketing assistant when my responsibilities became too much for just one person to handle.<br/>
Through hard work and dedication, myself and the small team I had built were able to grow the iConcerts business from a single one hour slot on a CCTV cable channel to multiple high value content distribution deals across all major provinces in China with the biggest media groups around, including CCTV, CIBN, Youku, iQiyi and Shanghai Media Group.</p>
<p>

I learned so much during my time in China that it would take several pages to even cover the first year there, and my time working for iConcerts on the databases and developing the website inspired me to dedicate myself to a career in Web Development. Currently I am back in the UK training to follow my passion in web design and development to the next level.<br/>

I work with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and Ruby on Rails and have a working knowledge of PHP, as well as use of Wordpress and Drupal CMS systems, so please get in contact if you are looking for someone absolutely dedicated to self-improvment to join your team!
