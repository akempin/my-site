        <h3>Hi, I'm Adam Kempin. This is my design portfolio where I share all my favourite work.</h3>
        <p>
        Iâ€™ve been living in China for the last 7 years, where I originally went to learn Chinese while working in a charitable position teaching English for the British Council in a high school in Tianjin. After finishing my contract I moved on to teach EFL at Web International English, who focus on teaching graduates and business professionals and who are one of most successful English training schools in China.</p>

<p>I then took a job with iConcerts and moved to Beijing, where I have worked for the last 4 years as Operations Manager. For iConcerts China I managed all business development and contracts as well as contractual obligations with our Chinese partners, as well as every day programme delivery, translation, logistics, metadata and rights management.</p>

<p>Since I was the sole representative of iConcerts in China I was required to take on a variety of roles, and as such I proved myself to be capable of taking on and adapting to new roles incredibly quickly. These roles included but were limited to development and design of the iConcerts website, creating promotional and marketing materials, meeting and sourcing new clients and presenting iConcerts services and content, translating at business meetings as well as translating and amending contracts.</p>

<p>Through hard work and dedication, my small team and I were able to grow the iConcerts business from a single one hour slot on a CCTV cable channel to multiple high value content deals across all major provinces with the biggest media groups in China, including CCTV, CIBN, Youku, iQiyi and Shanghai Media Group.
